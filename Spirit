## Spirit Lake Tunnel Repair, Mount St. Helens, Washington

**Project description:** The Spirit Lake Tunnel is a two mile long emergency overflow pipe that 1984, was cored through a western ridge to 
relieve flooding problems that were created as a result of the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. The purpose of this project was to identify 
and repair a 200 foot portion of the tunnel that had failed due to earch movement.  We established control along the entire length of the tunnel 
and then modelled the failed portion of the structure.  Metal ribs were installed to repair the damaged portion.  We then captured 3D scanned data 
using ground based lidar to record as-built data for the repaired tunnel.
