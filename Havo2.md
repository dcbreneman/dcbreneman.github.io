## National Park Service, Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii

**Project description:** The purpose of this project was to prepare an existing conditions map for improvements to the entrance 
and visitor's center at Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island of Hawaii.  I used GPS and terrestrial traverse to establish 
ground control throughout the project limits.  I then incoperated GPS and terrestrial topography to create a map which included 
contours, utilities, trees, structures, roads, and parking.  The topographic survey was supplemented with ground based lidar.
