## Amtrak Station, Salinas, California

**Project description:** As a project manager at Otak, I provided services to assist with land surveys and topographic site surveys for Amtrakâ€™s Accessible Station 
Development Program. This federally mandated program upgrades rail stations so they comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. This project 
included terrestrial survey, GPS, 3D scanning, and UAV photogrammetry. In addition to this site, we performed topographic and boundary surveys at sites in
Oregon, Washington, California, Montana, and Idaho.
